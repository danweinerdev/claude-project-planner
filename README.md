# SDD Planner

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin for spec-driven development — structured project planning end-to-end. It provides slash commands that guide you through a full planning lifecycle — from research to retrospective — with YAML-frontmatter-driven artifacts.

For the optional HTML dashboard view of these artifacts, install the companion [`sdd-dashboard`](https://github.com/danweinerdev/sdd-dashboard-plugin) plugin.

## How It Works

SDD Planner is a standalone Claude Code **plugin**. When loaded (via `--plugin-dir` or through a marketplace), it registers 16 slash commands (namespaced under `/sdd-planner:*`) and 8 review/implementation agents that Claude can delegate to. All artifacts are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter — companion tools (like `sdd-dashboard`) read frontmatter exclusively, so there's no brittle table parsing.

    end

    end

## Quick Start

### From any repo

```bash
# From the repo where you want planning artifacts to live
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/sdd-planner

# Then inside Claude:
> /sdd-planner:setup
# Generates planning-config.json, bootstraps directories
```

`/sdd-planner:setup` lays out planning artifacts wherever you want them — at the repo root (planningRoot of `"."`), under a subdirectory (e.g. `"Planning"`), or in an entirely separate directory pointed at by an absolute path. See [Where Planning Artifacts Live](#where-planning-artifacts-live) below for the trade-offs.

### Use with git worktrees

Run `/sdd-planner:setup` in each worktree. Setup auto-detects worktrees and inherits `planningRoot` from siblings:

```bash
# In the first worktree — provide the planning root explicitly
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/sdd-planner
> /sdd-planner:setup /path/to/worktree --planning-root /path/to/planning-repo

# In subsequent worktrees — settings are inherited automatically
> /sdd-planner:setup /path/to/another-worktree
```

Each worktree gets its own `planning-config.json` and `claude.sh` launcher.

## Slash Commands

All commands are namespaced as `/sdd-planner:*` automatically by the plugin system.

### Lifecycle Commands

| Command | Purpose | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/sdd-planner:setup` | Set up a repo for planner | `planning-config.json`, `claude.sh`, directories |
| `/sdd-planner:research` | Investigate a topic | `Research/<topic>.md` |
| `/sdd-planner:brainstorm` | Explore possibilities | `Brainstorm/<topic>.md` |
| `/sdd-planner:specify` | Write requirements | `Specs/<feature>/README.md` |
| `/sdd-planner:design` | Technical architecture | `Designs/<component>/README.md` |
| `/sdd-planner:plan` | Create implementation plan | `Plans/New/<Name>/README.md` + phase docs |
| `/sdd-planner:breakdown` | Add detail to plan phases | Updates phase `.md` with tasks/subtasks |
| `/sdd-planner:implement` | Execute a plan phase | Code + updated task/phase statuses |

For the HTML dashboard and quick text status, install the companion [`sdd-dashboard`](https://github.com/danweinerdev/sdd-dashboard-plugin) plugin. It adds `/sdd-dashboard:dashboard` and `/sdd-dashboard:status`.

## Workflow Lifecycle

Commands follow a natural planning progression. You don't have to use every step — jump in wherever makes sense. Utility commands can be used at any point.

## Plan Hierarchy

Plans follow a four-level hierarchy, similar to Jira's project structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Plan["Plan (README.md)"] --> Phase1["Phase 1 (01-Setup.md)"]
    Plan --> Phase2["Phase 2 (02-API.md)"]
    Plan --> Phase3["Phase 3 (03-UI.md)"]
    Phase1 --> T1["Task 1.1"]
    Phase1 --> T2["Task 1.2"]
    T1 --> S1["☐ Subtask"]
    T1 --> S2["☐ Subtask"]
    T2 --> S3["☐ Subtask"]

    classDef plan fill:#5a4a7a,stroke:#333,color:#fff

    classDef task fill:#6a5a3a,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    classDef sub fill:#555,stroke:#333,color:#fff

    class Plan plan
    class Phase1,Phase2,Phase3 phase
    class T1,T2 task
    class S1,S2,S3 sub
```

| Level | Stored in | Status values |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Plan** | `Plans/{New,Ready,Active,Complete}/<Name>/README.md` frontmatter | `draft` `approved` `active` `complete` `archived` |
| **Phase** | `Plans/<status>/<Name>/01-Phase.md` frontmatter | `planned` `in-progress` `complete` `blocked` `deferred` |
| **Task** | Phase frontmatter `tasks:` array | `planned` `in-progress` `complete` `blocked` `deferred` |
| **Subtask** | Phase body as `- [ ]` checklists | Checkbox state |

## Agents

The plugin includes review agents that Claude can delegate to:

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `researcher` | Sonnet | Gathers context from artifacts, codebase, and web |
| `plan-reviewer` | Sonnet | Reviews plans for completeness, feasibility, and conventions |
| `spec-reviewer` | Haiku | Reviews specs for testability, completeness, and ambiguity |
| `code-implementer` | Opus | Implements code from plan tasks in the target codebase |
| `drift-detector` | Sonnet | Diff + plan only — missing work, scope creep, approach drift |
| `quality-scanner` | Sonnet | Diff + code only (intent-blind) — correctness, safety, maintainability, over-engineering |
| `spec-compliance` | Sonnet | Diff + specs/designs only — requirements coverage, contract violations |
| `blind-spot-finder` | Sonnet | Diff only — adversarial fresh-eyes reviewer |

### Code Review Architecture

`/code-review` dispatches the four specialized reviewers **from the primary context** (the slash command itself), because Claude Code does not allow subagents to spawn other subagents. The orchestration is inside the slash command, not an intermediate orchestrator agent.

```mermaid
graph TD
    primary["Primary context<br/>(/code-review command)<br/>loads only metadata,<br/>dispatches + synthesizes"]
    drift["sdd-planner:drift-detector<br/>diff + plan"]
    qual["sdd-planner:quality-scanner<br/>diff + code<br/>(intent-blind)"]
    spec["sdd-planner:spec-compliance<br/>diff + specs/designs"]
    blind["sdd-planner:blind-spot-finder<br/>diff only"]

    primary -->|parallel Task dispatch| drift
    primary -->|parallel Task dispatch| qual
    primary -->|parallel Task dispatch| spec
    primary -->|parallel Task dispatch| blind
    drift --> primary
    qual --> primary
    spec --> primary
    blind --> primary
    primary -->|synthesized report| user["User"]

    classDef primary fill:#5a4a7a,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    classDef sub fill:#3a5a6a,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    classDef user fill:#4a6741,stroke:#333,color:#fff

    class primary primary
    class drift,qual,spec,blind sub
    class user user
```

- **Primary context (`/code-review`)** identifies the plan/phase/repo/diff-scope references, reads only the plan's `related` frontmatter to find spec/design paths, and resolves a concrete `git diff` range. It does **not** read plan bodies, spec bodies, design bodies, or full diff contents.
- **Four specialized reviewers** run in parallel in their own fresh contexts. Each sees only the inputs for its lane. `blind-spot-finder` in particular sees only the diff — no plan, no specs, no designs — because its adversarial value depends on that isolation.
- **`drift-detector`, `quality-scanner`, and `blind-spot-finder`** validate every finding against the full file and calling context, not just the diff hunk, because diffs lie by omission.
- **Primary context** then synthesizes the four reports — highlighting confirmed findings (caught by 2+ reviewers), disagreements between reviewers (often the most valuable signal), and blind spots only `blind-spot-finder` caught — and presents the unified review to the user.

**Hard contract:** `/code-review` must dispatch the four sub-agents via Task. It must not do the review in primary and present it as a four-lane result. If any dispatch fails, the command returns a loud error and stops — there is no fallback to self-synthesis.

`/implement` dispatches `quality-scanner` directly after each task for a fast intent-blind quality check. `/simplify` dispatches it in `simplify` mode for complexity analysis. Both bypass the full four-lane review because the question they're asking is local to the code at hand.

### MCP Server Inheritance

The plugin aims to be **generic** — it should work with whatever MCP servers your project has configured without hard-coding server names. It achieves this by splitting agents into two groups:

| Group | Agents | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Inherit session tools** (no `tools:` frontmatter) | `researcher`, `code-implementer`, `quality-scanner` | Automatically pick up any MCP servers available in the session — `context7`, Linear, Notion, Slack, whatever. They use these for library docs, ticket lookups, and API verification. Guardrails in the agent body keep `researcher` and `quality-scanner` read-only. |
| **Restricted allowlist** (`tools:` frontmatter) | `plan-reviewer`, `spec-reviewer`, `drift-detector`, `spec-compliance`, `blind-spot-finder` | Tight allowlist of built-in tools only. No MCP access. These agents depend on intent isolation — the value of `blind-spot-finder` is that it's given only the diff; adding MCPs would dilute that. |

If you want stricter guarantees on the inheriting agents (e.g., preventing `code-implementer` from touching your ticketing MCP), drop an override into your project's `.claude/agents/<name>.md` — project-local agents take precedence over plugin-provided ones and can declare an explicit `tools:` list of your choosing.

Recommended MCP servers to install for the best experience:
- **context7** — current library docs. `researcher`, `code-implementer`, and `quality-scanner` all benefit immediately.
- Any project-relevant knowledge-base MCP (Linear, Notion, Confluence, Jira) — `researcher` will use them to pull in reverse references during planning.

## Where Planning Artifacts Live

`planningRoot` in `planning-config.json` is just a path. It can be relative or absolute — the plugin doesn't care. Pick whichever suits your repo layout:

| `planningRoot` value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `"."` (or omitted) | Artifacts live at the repository root. Useful when the repo's whole purpose is planning. |
| `"Planning"` (relative) | Artifacts live in a subdirectory of the current repo. Useful when planning lives next to code. |
| `"/home/user/Code/my-planning-repo"` (absolute) | Artifacts live in an external directory, often shared by multiple code repos. |

Plans can reference code in other repos via `repositories` and `planMapping`:

```json
{
  "planningRoot": ".",
  "repositories": {
    "my-app": { "github": "org/my-app" }
  },
  "planMapping": {
    "MyPlan": { "repo": "my-app" }
  },
  "planRepository": "my-app"
}
```

Absolute filesystem paths to those code repos go in `planning-config.local.json` (gitignored):

```json
{ "repositories": { "my-app": { "path": "/home/user/Code/my-app" } } }
```

## Dashboard

The HTML dashboard previously bundled with this plugin has moved to a companion plugin, [`sdd-dashboard`](https://github.com/danweinerdev/sdd-dashboard-plugin). Install it alongside `sdd-planner` to get:

- `/sdd-dashboard:dashboard` — regenerate the static HTML dashboard from artifact frontmatter
- `/sdd-dashboard:status` — quick text-only status summary (read-only)

The dashboard is opt-in via `"dashboard": true` in `planning-config.json` (plus optional `title` / `description` for the page chrome). If you don't install the companion plugin, those fields are simply ignored.
