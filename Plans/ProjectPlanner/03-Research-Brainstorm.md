### Subtasks
- [ ] Define agent with Sonnet model
- [ ] Configure tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch
- [ ] Define compound knowledge loop behavior
- [ ] Define structured output format

## 3.2: Create /research skill

### Subtasks
- [ ] Define skill frontmatter and triggers
- [ ] Document process invoking researcher agent
- [ ] Reference research template

## 3.3: Create /brainstorm skill

### Subtasks
- [ ] Define skill frontmatter and triggers
- [ ] Document brainstorm process (no agent needed)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Researcher agent gathers context from existing artifacts
- [ ] /research produces well-structured research documents
